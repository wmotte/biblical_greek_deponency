# Quantitative Analysis of the ‘Deponency’ in Biblical Greek

This repository contains the input data, scripts and Suppl. Tables and Figures from a study that employs distributional linguistics, a newly introduced technique at multiple Dutch and Flemish research groups, to examine the controversial concept of verbal ‘deponency’ in Biblical Greek. 

Renaissance grammarians introduced ‘deponency’ as an additional classifier to the traditional voice paradigm (active, middle, passive) to account for verbs exhibiting middle-passive morphology with active interpretation. 

While contemporary New Testament scholars often dismiss this classification as superfluous, advocating for its reintegration into the middle voice category, our distributional analysis of the LXX-NT corpus reveals distinct grammatical patterns. 

The analyses demonstrates that ‘deponent’ verbs inhabit grammatical contexts more closely aligned with active voice rather than middle voice forms. 

These findings suggest that Renaissance grammatical insights merit reconsideration, potentially warranting a reassessment of deponency’s role in Greek verbal taxonomy rather than its wholesale rejection from contemporary linguistic analysis.
